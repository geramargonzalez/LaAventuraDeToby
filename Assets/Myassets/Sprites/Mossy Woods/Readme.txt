Hand Painted 2d "Mossy Woods" Background
By Trideka Designs




Firstly, thanks for purchasing this asset! 



Included in this package are as follows:



Example Folder
:
	A dead simple example of how to use the asset.
	
	
	Included is a very simple parallax scrolling script,
 created by Unity Tech for their 2D Character tutorial.

	
	It should be noted that this script does not handle infinite tiling,
 nor does it deal with vertical parallax very well (or at all.) 
	It may
	be in your interest to write your own, or find another on the Asset Store!
	
	
	
	Playing the scene enables a scripted animation on the camera
 to simply move it from left to right, to show off
	
	the parallaxing effect. 
The component can be found within the Camera
 gameobject. Access it to change scrolling speed.

	

	A note on the scene's setup:
		
		To examplify that the art does indeed tile, I had to work around the
 parallaxing script by adding duplicates of the background sprites,
		
		and parented them to their first instances in the hierarchy.
		
		
		
		This breaks the prefab instance. The "Mossy Woods" prefab found in the
	assets folder is not setup as such, 
		and it is up to the asset store customer to best deal
 with how they want their parallaxing to work. 

		Please feel free to contact me should you need
 help however!


		Take note that attached as children to the Main Camera game object are the Sunrays.

		These are parented to the Main Camera so that they don't scroll with the parallax!


		Two of the foreground Sunrays are controlled by an Animation Controller, which animates their 
opacity, giving the illusion of dapled 
		sunlight coming through the forest canopy. 


		Each Sunray is ordered within the Default sorting layer so that it cleanly fits between the varying
		layers of the woods without causing Z-Order issues. You may wish to rearrange, or remove them entirely.
	

Art Folder
:
	Contains all the layers of the background art

	
"Mossy Woods.prefab"
:
	A simple prefab with all the image layers
 grouped together and ready to go.



	Simply drag it into your scene view.

 Within the prefab are the 
layers of the background. 
	Presently they are set to
 the "Default" sorting layer, and are ordered within it. 
	You may want to change this to your own background sorting layer to customize for yourself.
